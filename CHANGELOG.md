# Changelog

This file tracks changes across development of the `SortTEMPLATE` repository. 

## 0.1.X Version

The `0.1.X` series, starting with the `0.1.0` tagged release is the first stable release 
of the template. This release version is considered a stable release, and should maintain
compatibility across the `0.1.X` series, with no breaking changes. 

## Development Version

Prior to the 0.1.0 release, there was continuous updates and changes to the tempalte.

Through this time, the general layout and organzation matched what became the `0.1.0` version, 
however, there could be breaking changes at any time, and compatibility which future 
tagged versions is not guaranteed.
