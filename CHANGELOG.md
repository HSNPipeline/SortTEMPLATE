# Changelog

This file tracks changes across development of the `PrepTEMPLATE` repository.

## 1.0.X Version

The `1.0.X` series, starting with the `1.0.0` tagged release is a major update / breaking
change update to the template, following the `1.0.0` release of `hsntools` (formerly `convnwb`).

This update uses the new naming scheme of `hsntools-1.0.0`.

Note that prior to this release, this was called the `SortTEMPLATE`.

## 0.4.X Version

The `0.4.X.` series, starting with the `0.4.0` tagged release is a major update to the template,
which now integrates the use of the `convnwb` module (v0.4.0).

Note that in order to maintain version number alignment with `convnwb` and the other HSN
templates, this template jumps from `0.1.0` to `0.4.0` (there are no `0.2.0` or `0.3.0` versions).

## 0.1.X Version

The `0.1.X` series, starting with the `0.1.0` tagged release is the first stable release
of the template. This release version is considered a stable release, and should maintain
compatibility across the `0.1.X` series, with no breaking changes.

## Development Version

Prior to the 0.1.0 release, there was continuous updates and changes to the template.

Through this time, the general layout and organization matched what became the `0.1.0` version,
however, there could be breaking changes at any time, and compatibility which future
tagged versions is not guaranteed.
